# autonomous_robot
This project consists of making a robot using a LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Education Kit, and the mission of this robot is to navigate the robot in the room autonomously, without colliding with any obstacles present in the room. I have used three motors, one EV3 brick, onw touch sensor and one ultrasonic sensor for this project.
